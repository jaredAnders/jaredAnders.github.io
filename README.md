# jaredAnders.github.io
This site was built to serve as a digital resume while showcasing and expanding my development skill set. As a self-taught front-end developer, I began with a limited knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS and ended up exposing myself to new libraries and development techniques.

## Technologies Explored
* Git/GitHub
* Gulp
* Sass
* BrowserSync
* Chart.js
* AJAX
* SVG

## TODO
* Rebuild with React
* Add portfolio section w/links to projects
* Replace skills chart with D3 based sunburst chart
* Make bio interactive/conversational
* Add touch/swipe functionality
* Improve button/menu animations
* Refactor for performance optimization

## Notes
Please excuse the ugliness of this code. It was the first project I built from scratch. I would refactor...but I'd rather just start over and build with React.
