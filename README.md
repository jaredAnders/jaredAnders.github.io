# Personal Site
This is the first project I built from scratch in my free time as a self-taught front-end developer. What was originally intended to be a digital resume turned into an educational journey. Along the way, I researched and experimented with various tools and technologies while putting my front-end fundamentals to the test. From configuring a build pipeline and setting up a local dev server to working with SVGs, I explored many concepts and technologies throughout the world of web development. Looking back, this might not be the cleanest code I've ever written, but I'm proud of it.
