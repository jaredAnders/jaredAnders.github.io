        <h3>tl;dr</h3>
        <p>
          I am a Full Stack Web Developer with 3 years of JavaScript and front-end development experience. Over the past year, I have studied computer science fundamentals and added Ruby, Rails and React to my stack. With over 4 years of experience in roles spanning across IT, marketing and operations, I bring a well rounded technical and business perspective to the table with an eagerness to learn.
        </p>
        <span id="read-more">
          <h3>Excel => JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            It all started with Excel. In my first job after college, I began with vlookups and if statements before diving into more advanced functions. Within three months, I was assigned to a three-person team focused on a new product line with a unique distribution channel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeking to improve our workflow, I assembled an intranet using Google Apps. As it began to outgrow the spreadsheet functions, I taught myself JavaScript in order to utilize Google Apps Script. Over the next six months, the intranet evolved to incorporate order processing, a ticketing system for technical issues, coordination of deliveries, a product wiki, live reporting and more.
          </p>

          <h3>JavaScript => Front-end</h3>
          <p>
            Gaining recognition for the intranet, I was offered a position on the eCommerce team. In this role, I began building landing pages with HTML, CSS and jQuery for an IBM WebSphere Commerce based B2B site. As I started to work more with our IT and Web Development teams, I was introduced to the LAMP stack, including technologies like WordPress, phpMyAdmin and MySQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            After nine months in this role, I accepted a job at a specialty pharmacy which involved managing UX improvements for a .NET based application, building landing pages, maintaining a Drupal site, analyzing web traffic and driving digital strategy.
          </p>

          <h3>Front-end => Full-stack</h3>
          <p>
            As I dug deeper into the front-end, I gained a desire to understand the big picture of computer science. Starting with the fundamentals, I began with HarvardX’s Intro to Computer Science. Then, I revisited JavaScript, exploring OOP and tools like NPM, Gulp, Sass and Webpack before jumping into React. The more I learned, the more I realized how much further I had to go. In order to accelerate my education, I enrolled full-time in a 6 month bootcamp focused on Ruby and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            To establish a solid foundation, I worked with <a href="https://github.com/jaredAnders/challenges" target="_blank">data structures and algorithms</a>. Building off these fundamentals, I gained an understanding of MVC architecture by building increasingly <a href="https://github.com/jaredAnders/movio" target="_blank">complex Rails applications</a>. Throughout this process, I became very familiar with tools like Git, GitHub, Heroku and AWS, as well as Test-Driven Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            For my final project, I worked as a member of a distributed agile team to build a Rails based chess app. Under guidance of <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/coutermarsh">Mike Coutermarsh</a>, Software Engineer at Product Hunt, we followed a TDD workflow, regularly performed code reviews and pair-programmed to ensure a consistent, well-tested and team-friendly codebase.
          </p>

          <h3>What’s Next</h3>
          <p>
            I'm looking for an opportunity to learn and be challenged as a member of an ambitious engineering team. Currently, I'm working on a Rails app that consumes the Spotify API. Over the coming weeks, I plan on building out a React front-end. Then, I’d love to learn Python in order to take courses on advanced algorithms, networking, security and machine learning. Please take a look at my code on <a href="https://github.com/jaredAnders" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, feel free to connect with me via <a href="https://angel.co/jared-gilbert" target="_blank">AngelList</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredagilbert" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, or <a href="#contact">contact me directly</a> using the form below.
