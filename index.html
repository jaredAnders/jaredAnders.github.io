        <h3>tl;dr</h3>
        <p>
          With over 4 years of professional experience in roles spanning across IT, marketing and operations, I bring a well rounded technical and business perspective to the table with an eagerness to learn. I have over 3 years of experience with JavaScript and front-end development, and have added React, Ruby and Rails to my stack within the past year.
        </p>

          <h3>Excel => JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            It all started with Excel. In my first job after college, I started working with vlookups and if statements before diving into more advanced functions and eventually dabbling - ever so slightly - with VBA. Three months later, I moved within the department to a three-person team focused on a new product line with a unique distribution channel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeking to improve the team’s workflow, I configured an intranet using Google Apps to track and resolve production issues. As the intranet gained traction, it quickly outgrew the standard spreadsheet functions, so I taught myself JavaScript in order to leverage Google Apps Script. Over the next six months, the intranet evolved to incorporate order processing, a ticketing system for technical issues, coordination of deliveries, a product wiki, live reporting and more.
          </p>

          <h3>JavaScript => Front-end</h3>
          <p>
            Gaining recognition for the intranet, I was offered a position on the eCommerce team. In this role, I began building landing pages with HTML, CSS and jQuery for an IBM Sterling based B2B store. As I started to work more with our IT and Web Development teams, I was introduced to the LAMP stack, including technologies like WordPress, phpMyAdmin and MySQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            After nine months in this role, I accepted a job at a specialty pharmacy which involved leading UX improvements for an Umbraco/.NET based application, building landing pages, maintaining a Drupal site, analyzing web traffic and driving digital strategy.
          </p>

          <h3>Front-end => Full-stack</h3>
          <p>
            As I dug deeper into the front-end, I gained an appreciation for and desire to understand the bigger picture of computer science and web development. Starting with the fundamentals, I began with HarvardX’s Intro to Computer Science. Then, I revisited JavaScript, exploring OOP and tools like NPM, Gulp, Sass and Webpack, most of which I used to develop this site, before jumping into React. At this point, I decided to <a href="https://www.thefirehoseproject.com" target="_blank">accelerate my education</a> by enrolling full-time in a 6 month bootcamp focused on Ruby and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            To establish a solid foundation, I’ve worked with data structures and algorithms in both Ruby and JavaScript throughout the program. To build off these skills and gain an understanding of MVC architecture, I’ve developed multiple applications using Rails, deployed to production with Heroku and become very familiar with Git/GitHub, AWS and Test-Driven Development. For our final project, I am working as a member of an agile team to build a chess app. In addition to the bootcamp curriculum, I’ve been taking courses and following tutorials on React and Redux, as well as more advanced algorithms based courses.
          </p>

          <h3>What’s Next</h3>
          <p>
            With graduation approaching at the end of January 2017, I’m looking to join an experienced engineering team where I can continue to grow and learn. Over the coming weeks, I plan on working with React and Redux more, then Python in order to begin courses on Networking, Security, Cryptocurrency and ML/AI.
